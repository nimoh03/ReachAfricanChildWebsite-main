            The mission of RACEEI is to make education more inclusive,
            accessible, relevant, and transformative (for both students and
            teachers) through training, support, and research; empowering every
            child with the tools of formal and non-formal education to the end
            that each child and teacher may be prepared to face the future with
            the confidence that comes with knowledge, skills, and values for a
            sustainable future.

            RACEEI envisions a world where every child, especially the girl
            child, can discover and maximize potential towards
            self-actualization and economic viability â€“ and in turn give back to
            their communities. RACEEIplans to achieve this vision through a
            painstaking pursuit of these objectives: All children are
            essentially literate | have equal access to quality learning
            opportunities | achieve economic and social independence for every
            child through education | empower every girl child for future
            relevance through education | sustain good practices towards self
            and the environment

            Our goal is to empower over ten million (10 000 000) children with
            the necessary tool kit of education in its formal, non-formal forms
            by the year 2035. The Drive RACEEI is driven to serve and represent
            populations whose voices are least likely to be heard when policies
            are made and resources are allocated especially with respect to
            Quality Education. RACEEI therefore wants to contribute to helping
            first, the girl child; and the poor and vulnerable who live in the
            rural and impoverished metropolitan areas gain access to quality
            education and sustainable lifestyles that lead to improved and
            functional literacy, economic empowerment, a safer and sustainable
            environment, cooperation and peace. The target of REACH, therefore,
            are: AWARENESS, QUALITY EDUCATION and EMPOWERMENT.
